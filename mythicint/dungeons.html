            <h2>Dungeon Mythic+ Affixes</h2>
            <p>Dungeons have levels of difficulty which bring us to the core of what Mythic Dungeon International is – Mythic+ (called Mythic Plus). Mythic+ goes beyond the regular difficulties of Normal, Heroic, and Mythic, wherein you have a Keystone that has a corresponding number to determine the level of difficulty and how many affixes are attached to that Keystone. </p>
            <p>For example, say I get a Keystone for Court of Stars Dungeon at +4 difficulty. That will give me 2 affixes and be considered 4 levels tougher than a plain Mythic Dungeon, 4 levels tougher than a Heroic Dungeon, and 6 levels tougher than a Normal Dungeon.</p>
            <p>An affix is a modifier applied to a mythic keystone at set levels. Different combinations occur every week, with the combinations repeating on a set schedule.</p>
