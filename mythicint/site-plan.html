      <p>
        World of Warcraft is an MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) which means that its completely online. You are constantly around and interacting with other players who are in your region, area, world, etc. Dungeons in the game are referred to as ‘instanced content’ where you will be put through a loading screen and put in an instance that has specific rules and restrictions. If I go into a Dungeon, I can only bring up to 4 other players with me, so five players being the max number.

      </ul>
      <h3>Dungeons</h3>
      <p>
        Dungeons have levels of difficulty which bring us to the core of what Mythic Dungeon International is – Mythic+ (called Mythic Plus). Mythic+ goes beyond the regular difficulties of Normal, Heroic, and Mythic, wherein you have a Keystone that has a corresponding number to determine the level of difficulty and how many affixes are attached to that Keystone.
