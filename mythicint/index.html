            <h2>Welcome to Warcraft E-Sports</h2>
            <p>This site is to provide basic rundown of what to expect when first watching World of Warcraft: Dragonflight E-Sports. There are multiple types of E-Sports in World of Warcraft that are essentially broken up into two categories: PvE (Player versus Environment) and PvP (Player versus Player). PvE is what the Mythic Dungeon International is, as the environment in this case is creatures and objects that are in the game and coded a certain way.</p>
            <p>World of Warcraft is an MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) which means that its completely online. You are constantly interacting with other players who are in your region or area, and sometimes across the world. Dungeons in the game are referred to as ‘instanced content’ where you will be put through a loading screen and put in an instance that has specific rules and restrictions.</p>

            <h2>How Do Dungeons Work?</h2>
            <p>The make-up of Dungeon groups is based on role. For a 5-man instance, the typical group will have 1 tank, 1 healer, and 3 DPS. </p>
            <p><b>Tank</b>: soaks all the damage and ‘taunts’ all enemies to attack them to keep most of the damage away from the rest of the group. Tanks are generally seen as the ‘leader’ of the group who choose the pathing of the dungeon and how many mobs (creatures in the dungeons) to pull.</p>
            <p><b>Healer</b>: self-explanatory; the healer is in charge of keeping everyone alive and has to be very conscious of the group’s health bars and debuffs.</p>
            <p><b>DPS (Damage Per Second / Damage Dealers)</b>: the DPS are the ones doing the most damage in the group in various different ways depending on the class they are. Most all DPS also have various utility that they bring to the group (i.e. stunning large groups at a time, interrupting spellcasts, providing group buffs, etc.) and that often determines how useful they are or not. </p>
